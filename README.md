# True-or-False

Interactive quiz written in C#.

In this project, I build a C# program that presents a quiz the right way: using arrays and loops, it will check the format of user input and repeat the question if the format is incorrect.
After the quiz is complete, it will check the userâ€™s responses against the correct answers and present a score.
